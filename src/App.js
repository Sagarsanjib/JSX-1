        <p>At Zappos.com, our purpose is simple to live and deliver WOW.</p>


        <p>Twenty years ago, we began as a small online retailer that only sold shoes. Today, we still sell shoes-- as well as clothing, handbags, acessories, and more. That "more" is providing the very best customer service, customer experience, and company culture, we aim to inspire the world by showing it's possible to simultaneously deliver happiness to customers, employees, vendors, shareholders, and the community in a long-term, sustaibaible way.</p>

      
        <p> We hope that in the future people won't even realize we started selling shoes online. Instead, they'll know Zappos as a service comapny that just happens to sell _____.</p>
